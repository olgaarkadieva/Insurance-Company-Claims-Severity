# Insurance-Company-Claims-Severity

In this project i have used regression model to predict about particular claim. 

first i have loaded data from [train.csv file](Insurance-Company-Claims-Severity/train.csv) for training model 
and for testing model i have used data from [test.csv file](Insurance-Company-Claims-Severity/test.csv).

i have merged both data by using pandas library . then after merging data i have done data visualization and plot data as a figure . I have uploaded some of screenshot
[here](Insurance-Company-Claims-Severity/screenshot) 
After that i trained my model by usng Fit Grid Search Model

 
 I have commented my code to explain my project step by step
